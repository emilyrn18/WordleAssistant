# WordleAssistant
This project is to help people with the wordle puzzles by providing them with suggestion words to try based on letter frequency and already used words.

# How to Run
To run the project, open index.html into a web browser (only Chrome has been tested) and it should immediately prompt the user to input the first word they put into the wordle.

To view the recommended words, the user needs to open the inspector tool and view the console. This is where the script will provide the top 25 words to try next based on the previous words' results.
